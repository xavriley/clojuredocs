			<h2 style="text-align: left">A logic programming library for Clojure & ClojureScript. core.logic offers Prolog-like relational programming, constraint logic programming, and nominal logic programming for Clojure. At its heart is an original implementation of miniKanren as described in William Byrd's dissertation Relational Programming in miniKanren: Techniques, Applications, and Implementations as well as the extensions described in cKanren and Î±Kanren. It is designed to be easily extended to forms of logic programming beyond the ones provided.</h2>

				<h2>Getting started with Overtone Docs</h2>
				<p>Finding the right tool for the job can be tough, so we&apos;ve outlined a few ways to go about your search below.</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="wm_quickref">Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/overtone/overtone/raw/master/docs/cheatsheet/overtone-cheat-sheet.pdf">Overtone cheat sheet</a>, which displays Overtone vars grouped by category. Alternatively, browse the <a href="/quickref/overtone">Ugen quickref</a> for quick links to ugen docs, grouped by category too.</li>
					<li class="wm_alpha">Browse an alphabetical list of vars defined in <a href="/overtone">Overtone</a>.</li>
					<li class="wm_search"><a href="/search?q=sinosc">Search</a> for something.</li>

			<h2>Does this site look familiar?</h2>
			<p>This site is entirely based off of the great work done by <a href="https://github.com/zkim">zkim</a> and all on <a href="http://clojuredocs.org/">ClojureDocs.org</a>. You can help out that project by joining the mailing list and getting involved - it's also totally open source so you can contribute using Github. It looks like they're undergoing a transition to a new iteration of the site, so it may be that the latest work is going in a new direction, but I'm sure they're happy for people to take an interest.</p>
